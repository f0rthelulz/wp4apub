# wp4apub
This script installs WordPress on Ubuntu server running Apache

This script, as well as its' predecessor apa4ubu.sh, has not been tested thouroughly, nor ran recently. Updates will be posted to this file when I've had the chance to test current functionality and correct any potential issues. Otherwise, feel free to test, contribute, update, or improve the functionality or script in any way you see fit. Cheers!
